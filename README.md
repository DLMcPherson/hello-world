# hello-world
My first repository. A tutorial repository set up through the github guide: "https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/".

I am currently seeking to learn how to use Git and what branches and pull requests are. Several of my most esteemed colleagues have urged me to start using Git including Ben Evans and Andrew McPherson. In addition, when installing files onto my Linux machine, I've been forced to download source code from Git. What is this mysterious application? I must find out, or die trying!!!111!

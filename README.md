# hello-world
My first repository. A tutorial repository set up through the github guide: "https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/".

 Several of my most esteemed colleagues have urged me to start using Git including Ben Evans and Andrew McPherson.
 In addition, when installing files onto my Linux machine, I've been forced to download source code from Git.
 Most importantly though, my new lab's code is all kept in a GitHub repository making my knowledge of how to access his data paramount. 

What is this mysterious application? I must find out, or die trying!
